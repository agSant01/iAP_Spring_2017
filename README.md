# IAP RUM Application for Android 

An android application built natively which primary purpose is voting, but will feature useful information for the attendees of the Industrial Affiliates Program (IAP).

## About Industrial Affiliates Program

The Industrial AffiliatesProgram (IAP) is an innovative model of active learning.  Through undergraduate research, the program addresses today’s pressing needs of blending theory with practice, education with work, and academic scientific rigor with industry’s fast pace.

Funded in 1989 by the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) of the University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez Campus (UPRM). It is fully sponsored by companies who work closely with ECE faculty at UPRM. Participating students learn through research, enrich their academic experience and interact with new technologies. The program tests students' capacity to work independently and interdisciplinary at solving real problems and presenting their solutions to  the  public. In the process, they develop crucial skills including  critical  and creative thinking, teamwork, communication, organizational, and experimental skills.

## About IAP RUM

The Industrial Affiliates Program application provides a unique experience for company attendees. With the application the company representatives can see the different posters and connect with the students, with the student profiles they now have immediate access to resumes and contact information. Long gone are the days of paper evaluations, now representatives can evaluate posters and presentations through the application allowing the winner to be determined almost immediately. They can also see the conference itinerary and the student’s posters. The students and professors attending can vote for the best poster and best presentation and see their peer’s posters.
